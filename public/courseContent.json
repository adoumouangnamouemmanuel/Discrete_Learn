A tuple can contain elements of different types, such as integers, strings, or other tuples. The number of elements in a tuple is called its arity. The tuple with n elements is called an n-tuple. For example, a 2-tuple is an ordered pair, a 3-tuple is an ordered triple, and so on. Tuples are typically used in mathematics and computer science, where maintaining the order of elements is important.",
