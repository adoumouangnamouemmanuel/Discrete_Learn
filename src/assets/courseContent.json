These objects can be anything: numbers, names, shapes, or even other sets. Sets provide the foundation for various branches of mathematics and are fundamental to understanding relationships and operations between groups of objects.",

Clear Membership: It is always clear whether an object belongs to a set or not.\n4. Named Sets: Sets are typically represented using capital letters (e.g., A, B, C).",
