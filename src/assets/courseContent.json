These objects can be anything: numbers, names, shapes, or even other sets. Sets provide the foundation for various branches of mathematics and are fundamental to understanding relationships and operations between groups of objects.",

Clear Membership: It is always clear whether an object belongs to a set or not.\n4. Named Sets: Sets are typically represented using capital letters (e.g., A, B, C).",

Here are the most common types:\n1. **Finite Set:** A set that contains a definite number of elements. For example: A = {1, 2, 3}.\n2. **Infinite Set:** A set that contains an infinite number of elements. For example: N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}.\n3. **Equal Set:** Two sets that contain exactly the same elements. For example: A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {1, 2, 3}.\n4. **Null Set (Empty Set):** A set with no elements. For example: E = {} or E = Ø.\n5. **Singleton Set:** A set that contains only one element. For example: S = {7}.\n6. **Universal Set:** A set that contains all the elements under consideration, usually denoted by the symbol 'U'.",
